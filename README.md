# K&R C programming language 2nd edition solution

## My solution to the timeless C book by K&R

### What to expect?
Most solutions are fine, two or three of them are not working at all as I do this in an
one-month rush.

I will re-implement some of them when I feel like it.

The chapter 8 will also come later.

*(I did not intend to upload this at first but then later change my mind,
that's why there is one commit for all file from Chapter1 to Chapter7)*

### Execute/Run
- Make sure you have [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or any C compiler installed.
- For `gcc`, run the following to compile `main.c`

      gcc -o "choose_a_name_here".out main.c
- Input/Output for these simple programs can be keyboard and screen by default, or simple
text files `.txt`, varying by exercises

  *Everything in the form \*...\* is replaced by a file name, with no double quotes*
  -  To just run it with keyboard/screen I/O

          ./"file_name".out
  - Replacing the standard input/output with `.txt` files

        ./"file_name".out <"input.txt" >"output.txt"
  - Some require one, two or even more input files
    
        ./"file_name".out "input1.txt" "input2.txt" "input3.txt" . . .

### End

At this point of uploading this, I'm really just a nobody in programming or even less. If you feel some lines of
my code hurt your eyes, please make an issue and teach me sifu.
